# Multiple-Linear-Regression

**	CONTEXT :-**

The problem in investing in stocks is there is no good stock all the time, and investing at a bad time can be disastrous, while investment in a low value stock at the right time can make your huge profits. Thus the problem is what would be a good time to invest in the stock that is whether the stock is good or bad at a time.  
    So to determine if a stock is good or bad it becomes necessary to see the patterns based on which we can make a conclusion in regard to how a good stock behaves. Here the data on which we will analyze the patterns in the stock price which contains labelled data which means we have to use linear regression model which is a supervised machine learning model through which we will find the linear relationship between the dependent variable (close) and independent variable(open, low, high). The unit of these dependent and independent variables are in price.  
•	PROBLEM STATEMENT :-
The main objective of this project is to explore the New York Stock Exchange dataset and perform data analysis on the stock prices to determine a good time to invest in the stock.

•	DOWNLOADED FORMAT : The format of the dataset is a csv file.

**	DATA EXPLANATION :-**
The data has been taken from New York Stock Exchange dataset from kaggle. This dataset contains 7 variables with 851264 observations. The dataset has the values of opening and closing price of the stock of companies listed on NYSE over a period of 6 years from 2010 to 2016. The name of the variables are date, symbol, open, close, low, high, volume. This dataset contains labelled data. This means we have to use supervised machine learning model through which we will find the linear relationship between the dependent variable(close) in prices and independent variable(open, low, high) in prices. Thus we have to use linear regression model under supervised machine learning model.

**	INFERENCE :-**

We wanted to analyze the key features and trends of the stock based on which we could determine what would be a good time to invest in the stock. In my analysis, I have tried to add knowledge about stocks and their assessment has the potential to be the best investment.
I chose the price of the Willis Towers Watson’s (WLTW) stock. An insight into the stock’s price patterns will certainly help us understand the metrics involved in this process. In my venture, I have utilized multiple linear regression to predict the price.
Based on the analysis of the Willis Towers Watson’s (WLTW) stock price, it is evident that the stock price of a company is key metric in assessing the performance of the company as any successful ventures or failed strategy is reflected on the price and the pattern of the stock.
Investing in a stock of a high-performance company like WLTW can surely be a good choice, but from our analysis it is evident that short term gains might be risky but long-term gains are more likely.
In terms of short term gains it is always helpful to see the recent pattern in the price of the stock, the price of the stock in our case had a very high correlation value, so if the price has seen an upward trend recently it might be a good choice to invest in Willis Towers Watson’s (WLTW)’s stock, on the other hand if it’s a downward trend, it might be time to contact your custodian to sell it.
Another good way to determine the right time to invest in the stock is to assess what the company visions to achieve in the near future and what their products might have to offer. As, we see in Willis Towers Watson’s (WLTW)’s case the price of the stock grew around the time of their products’ launch.
